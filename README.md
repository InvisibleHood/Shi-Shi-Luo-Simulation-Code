# Shi-Shi-Luo Simulation Code
This project simulates the Shishi Luo's algorithm introduced in her paper "A unifying framework reveals key properties of multilevel selection" 

## Files

- `main.cpp`: Entry point of the simulation
- `simbox.cpp`: Original simulation implementation
- `simbox_simplified.cpp`: Faster, optimized version of the algorithm
- `Makefile`: For building and running different versions

## Usage

```bash
make
./main.out

make new
./new.out
